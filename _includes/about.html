  <p align="justify"> I am an astrophysicist, currently working at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (<a class="normal" target="_blank" href="http://www.mpe.mpg.de">MPE</a>) in Garching (Germany), where I am part of the Infrared and Submillimeter Group. My work in astronomy focuses on the development of astronomical instruments as well as on the study of stars that move around the supermassive black hole in the very center of our home galaxy. For the technical part of my work, I work on GRAVITY+, an update of the near-infrared interferometer GRAVITY. My goals include pushing the sensitivity limit of GRAVITY and studying the effects of polarization in near-infrared interferometry.

  Before coming to the MPE, I did my undergrad studies in Physics at Heidelberg University in Germany and did my master's project in collaboration with the the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg.
