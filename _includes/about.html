  <p align="justify"> I am a young scientist, currently working as a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (<a class="normal" target="_blank" href="http://www.mpe.mpg.de">MPE</a>) in Garching (Germany), where I am part of the Infrared and Submillimeter Group. My work in astronomy focuses on the development of astronomical instruments as well as on the study of stars that move around the supermassive black hole in the very center of our home galaxy. For the technical part of my work, I work on GRAVITY, a near-infrared interferometer, situated at the Very Large Telescope Interferomer (VLTI) in Chile. My current goals include pushing the sensitivity limit of GRAVITY and studying the effects of polarization in near-infrared interferometry.

  Before coming to the MPE, I did my undergrad studies in Physics at Heidelberg University in Germany. I finished my studies with the master's project about a new experiment for reconstructing the piston evolution and improving large optical interferometers (such as the VLTI or the LBT). This project was carried out at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. You can find my full CV <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="assets/docs/cv.pdf">here</a>.
