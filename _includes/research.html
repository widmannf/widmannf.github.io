        <h4 class="proj-title">GRAVITY</h4>
        <p align="justify"> <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/gravity">GRAVITY</a> is a second generation instrument at the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). It is a near infrared interferometer which coherently combines the light from four telescopes of the VLTI. Since its first light in 2016, GRAVITY is routinely doing phase-referenced interferometry of objects fainter than K > 17 mag.<br>
        Despite its great scientific results in different fields of astrometry, we are still working on improving GRAVITY. In this context, I focus on increasing the sensitivity limit as well as understanding the effects and the propagation of polarization in GRAVITY and in the VLTI in general. This work is a mixture of on-site experiments, data analysis, and simulations.

        <h4 class="proj-title">Galacitc Center Stars</h4>
        <p align="justify">The S-Stars are the stars closest to the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy. By monitoring these stars and their orbits around the central radio source for over 25 years, the galactic center team at MPE could show that there is indeed a supermassive black hole at the very center of our galaxy and could also measure and characterize that black hole. I work on the radial velocities of the stars closest to the black hole, observed with SINFONI at the VLT. By improving the accuracy of the velocity measurement, we can better characterize the stars and the black hole. With that we learn more about gravitation and can test the theory of general relativity in the very extreme case close to a supermassive black hole.

        <h4 class="proj-title">The Piston Reconstruction Experiement</h4>
        <p align="justify">For sensitive infrared interferometry, it is crucial to control the differential piston evolution between the used telescopes. This is classically done by the use of a fringe tracker. With this work, we developed a new method to reconstruct the temporal piston variation from the atmosphere, by using real-time data from adaptive optics wavefront sensing: the Piston Reconstruction Experiment (P-REx). <br>
        I extensively tested P-REx in simulations and could show that it should work under normal atmospheric conditions. The insights gained are then used to apply P-REx to real data, in order to demonstrate the benefit of using P-REx as an auxiliary system in a real interferometer. All tests show positive results, which encourages further research and eventually a real implementation. Especially the tests on on-sky data showed that the atmosphere is, under decent observing conditions, sufficiently well-structured and stable, in order to get a reliable wind vector from the adaptive optics data and apply P-REx. This project was carried out at the <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="https://www.mpia.de/">MPIA</a> in Heidelberg and is continued there.

        <h4 class="proj-title">SiO: Not the Perfect Outflow Tracer</h4>
        <p align="justify">We observed SiO emission in the young massive star formation region IRAS 19410+2336 with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI), in order to learn more about the outflow activity in this region. SiO is known to trace shocked gas, which is often associated with young energetic outflows. The SiO observations do not trace the previously in CO and H2 identified outflows well. Although we identified regions of highly increased SiO abundance, there are no clear bipolar structures (as expected from strong shocks) and only weak similarities with earlier data. We further investigated these observations and found various explanations for the emission from different regions. The SiO data show that several different effects can influence SiO emission, which makes the interpretation of SiO data more difficult than often assumed.
