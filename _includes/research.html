        <h4 class="proj-title">GRAVITY & GRAVITY+</h4>
        <p align="justify"> <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/gravity">GRAVITY</a> is a second generation instrument at the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). It is a near infrared interferometer which coherently combines the light from four telescopes of the VLTI. Since its first light in 2016, GRAVITY is routinely doing phase-referenced interferometry of objects fainter than K > 19 mag.<br>
        The instrument is currently receiving an extensive upgrade to <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="http://www.mpe.mpg.de/ir/gravityplus">GRAVITY+</a>, an all sky interferometer.
        On GRAVITY+ I am working on improved sensitvity, reduction of systematic effects in the instrument, and the development of the polarized oberving mode. My work is a mixture of on-site experiments, data analysis, and simulations.

        <h4 class="proj-title">Polarimetric Calibration</h4>
        <p align="justify">GRAVITY is the world leading interferometer in optical wavelength and reaches new limits on resolution and sensitivity. The instrument has an polarimetric observing mode, but to use this mode a full calibration of the VLTI is necessary. If have measured the polarimetric properties of each telescope and beam path and brought these measurements to a full calibratino model. This model is already regulalry used and enables the observing of polarized hotspots around supermassive black holes.

        <h4 class="proj-title">Galacitc Center Stars</h4>
        <p align="justify">The S-Stars are the stars closest to the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy. By monitoring these stars and their orbits around the central radio source for over 25 years, the galactic center team at MPE could show that there is indeed a supermassive black hole at the very center of our galaxy and could also measure and characterize that black hole. I work on the radial velocities of the stars closest to the black hole, observed with SINFONI at the VLT. By improving the accuracy of the velocity measurement, we can better characterize the stars and the black hole. With that we learn more about gravitation and can test the theory of general relativity in the very extreme case close to a supermassive black hole.

        <h4 class="proj-title">Testing the Equivalence Principle</h4>
        <p align="justify">With the improved radial velocities of the star S2 I led a project to measure deviations from the Einstein Equivalence Principle around the supermassive black hole. We found that the data is fully consistent with the assumptions of General Relativity, but it was the first test of this kind, done in the extreme pootential of a blck hole. The work was published in <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.101102">Physical Review Letters</a>.

        <h4 class="proj-title">The Piston Reconstruction Experiement</h4>
        <p align="justify">For sensitive infrared interferometry, it is crucial to control the differential piston evolution between the used telescopes. This is classically done by the use of a fringe tracker. With this work, we developed a new method to reconstruct the temporal piston variation from the atmosphere, by using real-time data from adaptive optics wavefront sensing: the Piston Reconstruction Experiment (P-REx). <br>
        I extensively tested P-REx in simulations and could show that it should work under normal atmospheric conditions. The insights gained are then used to apply P-REx to real data, in order to demonstrate the benefit of using P-REx as an auxiliary system in a real interferometer. All tests show positive results, which encourages further research and eventually a real implementation. This project was carried out at the <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="https://www.mpia.de/">MPIA</a> in Heidelberg and is continued there.

        <h4 class="proj-title">SiO: Not the Perfect Outflow Tracer</h4>
        <p align="justify">We observed SiO emission in the young massive star formation region IRAS 19410+2336 with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI), in order to learn more about the outflow activity in this region. SiO is known to trace shocked gas, which is often associated with young energetic outflows. The SiO observations do not trace the previously in CO and H2 identified outflows well. Although we identified regions of highly increased SiO abundance, there are no clear bipolar structures (as expected from strong shocks) and only weak similarities with earlier data. The SiO data show that several different effects can influence SiO emission, which makes the interpretation of SiO data more difficult than often assumed.
